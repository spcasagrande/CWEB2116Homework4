In order to set up the project, download Homework4Setup.msi and run the application. This will require admin privilages on order to run the set up wizard.

From there, simply start up the application.

The default username is "user1" with the password being "password1".

There are currently some issues with the program connecting to the database despite the pdb file being put into the setup project, so it might not connect properly. I am currently looking into how to solve this issue.
